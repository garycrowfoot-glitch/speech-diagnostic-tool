Condition,Typical phonetic/phonological patterns,Rule mapping (example),Clinical notes,Age_of_concern,Confidence_notes
Gliding,/ɹ/ → /w/; /l/ → /w/ or /j/,ɹæbɪt → wæbɪt (rabbit → wabbit),Common developmental process; persisting beyond expected age may indicate disorder.,Typically > 5-6 years,High for detection from phoneme substitutions; clinical interpretation required
Stopping,"Fricatives/affricates → stops (e.g. /s/ → /t/ , /ʃ/ → /t/)",sɪt → tɪt (sit → tit),Common in young children; persistent stopping may reflect phonological disorder.,Typically > 3-4 years,High for clear substitutions; need dialectal consideration
Fronting (Velar Fronting),"/k, g, ŋ/ → /t, d, n/",kæt → tæt (cat → tat),Developmental; backing instead is concerning.,Typically > 3-4 years,High
Backing,Anterior sounds → posterior (e.g. /t/ → /k/),tæt → kæt (tat → cat),Less common developmentally; often clinically significant.,Any age (concerning if persistent),Medium — must rule out phonetic context and hearing
Cluster Reduction,Consonant clusters simplified (e.g. /st/ → /t/),stɒp → tɒp (stop → top),Typical in early development; assess by age and consistency.,Typically > 4-5 years,High
Final Consonant Deletion,Omission of word-final consonant (/kæt/ → /kæ/),kæt → kæ (cat → ca),Developmental if young; persistent deletion affects intelligibility.,Typically > 3-4 years,High
Weak Syllable Deletion,Omission of unstressed syllables (banana → /nænə/ or /bænə/),bəˈnɑːnə → ˈnɑːnə (banana → nana),Common in early speech development.,Typically > 3-4 years,High
Voicing (Devoicing/Voicing Errors),Voiceless ↔ voiced substitutions (e.g. /p/↔/b/),pæn → bæn (pan → ban),Context-dependent; check phonetic environment and hearing.,Any age,Medium
Labialization,Coronal consonants produced with labial articulation (e.g. /s/ → /f/),sɪt → fɪt (sit → fit),May be phonetic or dialectal; consider dental structure,Any age,Medium
Palatalization,Non-palatal consonants produced with palatal quality (/t/ → /tʃ/),ti → tʃi (tea → chee),Assess coarticulation and phonotactic context.,Any age,Medium
Epenthesis,Insertion of an extra sound (often a vowel) in clusters (e.g. /bʌst/ → /bʌsət/),blæk → bəlæk (black → bulack),Common cross-linguistically; affects fluency of clusters.,Any age,Medium
Assimilation,One sound becomes similar to neighboring sound (e.g. /bæg/ → /gæg/),bæg → gæg (bag → gag),Can be phonological process or coarticulation; check patterns across tokens.,Typically early childhood,Medium
"Vowel Errors (Vowel Distortion, Diphthongization)",Vowel quality changes or monophthong ↔ diphthong shifts,ɪ → iː or ɪə (shortening/lengthening),Crucial for accent and intelligibility; may indicate motor or hearing issues.,Any age,Medium
Articulation Disorder (Speech Sound Disorder - Motoric),"Consistent distortions of phonemes (e.g. lateral /s/), limited to specific sounds",s → ɬ (lateralized s),Motor-based; errors are often consistent and predictable.,Any age,High for detection of distortions
Phonological Disorder,Patterns of multiple phoneme errors following phonological rules (e.g. multiple processes),Cluster reduction + stopping across many words,Language-based phonological knowledge difference; requires phonological assessment.,Typically noticed in childhood,High when multiple processes observed
Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS),"Inconsistent errors on consonants and vowels, disrupted coarticulatory transitions, inappropriate prosody","Inconsistent renditions: /bɛt/ → [bɛt], [bət], [bəːt]",Motor planning disorder; diagnosis requires clinical assessment (per Speech Pathology Australia).,Early childhood,Low for automated diagnosis — features detectable but clinical confirmation required
Dysarthria (Acquired/Developmental),"Consistent imprecise consonants, reduced range, slow rate, breathy/strained voice","But → bʌ̞t (centralized vowels, imprecise consonants)",Neuromuscular; often associated with neurological conditions.,Any age,Medium — acoustic measures helpful
Resonance Disorder (Hypernasality/Hyponasality),Nasalization of vowels; weak pressure consonants (plosives/ fricatives),s → [s̃] (nasalized s),Suggests velopharyngeal dysfunction; refer to ENT.,Any age,Medium — perceptual and instrumental measures required
Hearing Loss Related Speech Differences,"Omissions, distortions, voicing errors, reduced vowel contrast",high-frequency fricatives omitted,Always consider audiological assessment.,Any age,High — must co-assess with audiology
Fluency Disorder (Stuttering),"Repetitions, prolongations, blocks; secondary behaviors",b-b-bat; ssssoup,Not primarily a phonetic substitution issue but critical to note in recordings.,Early childhood to adult,High for detection of overt dysfluency
Selective Mutism / Speech Avoidance (Contextual),"Reduced output, absence in certain contexts",No verbal output in school context,Psychosocial/behavioral; not a phonetic disorder per se.,Childhood,N/A
Acquired Apraxia of Speech (Adult CAS),"Inconsistent errors, groping, slowed rate, prosodic disturbance after neurological event",variable productions across repeated attempts,Associated with stroke/brain injury; requires neurogenic assessment.,Adult,Low for automated diagnosis
Aphasic Speech (Aphasia-related articulation),"Phonemic paraphasias (sound substitutions), neologisms, phonological errors in connected speech",cat → dat (phonemic paraphasia),Language disorder with speech manifestations; requires neurological evaluation.,Adult,Medium
Foreign Accent / Dialectal Variation,"Systematic differences reflecting L1 or dialect (vowel shifts, consonant variation)","bath vowel variations, /t/ flapping)",Not a disorder; important to distinguish from impairment.,Any age,High — must account for L1 and dialect
